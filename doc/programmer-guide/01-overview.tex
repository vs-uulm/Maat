\chapter{Overview}

Conceptually, Maat consists of a few core components: the world model, input processing, detection, storage and API access. The world model can be seen as the data store, to which the API provides access. Applications can use this API to access stored data; the idea is that only reliable data is made available by default. The reliability of this data is assessed through detection, which is done through small applications called \emph{detectors}. Each detector outputs its' detection results using \emph{subjective logic}; this is stored alongside the data in the world model. Whenever an application requests information, Maat determines the reliability of the relevant stored data and outputs the reliable data to the application. The information and data stored in the world model enters it through some input pre-processing; it is possible for developers to add additional data sources to Maat by implementing the corresponding input processing and detector code.
